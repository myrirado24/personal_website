      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Cooking was something really important in my family and as I grow up I started to cook for myself. The more and more that I cooked I started to save recipes from my family, friends, the internet, and cookbooks. The more and more I collect recipes the more unorganized became they were all over the place, so one day as I was reorganizing my recipes I thought to myself: "It would be great if there was a way that I can organize my recipes in a better way"? with that in mind, I came up with the idea I create a recipe organizer that would be simple and easy to alter if needed. This would be great for people that love cooking and want to be organized.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Plate Pal's audiance are those who would like to take an interese on cooking or beaking. Keeping track of the many recipes that you cooked can be stressful and this tools will make it easier for those who like a more organized cookbook.</p>
