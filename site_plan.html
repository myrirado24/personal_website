      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Cooking was something really important in my family and as I grow up I started to cook for myself. The more and more that I cooked I started to save recipes from my family, friends, the internet, and cookbooks. The more and more I collect recipes the more unorganized became they were all over the place, so one day as I was reorganizing my recipes I thought to myself: "It would be great if there was a way that I can organize my recipes in a better way"? with that in mind, I came up with the idea I create a recipe organizer that would be simple and easy to alter if needed. This would be great for people that love cooking and want to be organized.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Plate Pal's audiance are those who would like to take an interese on cooking or beaking. Keeping track of the many recipes that you cooked can be stressful and this tools will make it easier for those who like a more organized cookbook.</p>

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The reason why people will come to my website will be the convenient and the simple way to organize recipes. With my experience I have many recipes that I have in many different places, in paper in my drawers, on my notes on my phone, and bookmarked on my search engine. There are a lot of places and I lose them all the time. This will fix that by having them all in one place. The home page will be an introduction to the user to what they can expect from my website. It will have a visual to and a brief bullet point on the website, and at the end it will have a few Q&A and reviews from current users for the new users.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Recipe book</h3>
      <p>
        This subpage is where the user will be able to add their recipes to their recipe book. On this page, the user will have the option to manually add the recipe, or if they want, they can directly link the recipe from another website to their recipe book. If the user wants to add the recipe manual there will be a lot of editor options like the title, ingredients section, and directions.  With the other option, if they donâ€™t want to type it, they can link it to another website. The ideal would be to have it filled out by the link but at least I want it to link to the page of the recipe.

      <h3>Meal Prep</h3>
      <p>
        For my second subpage, this will be where you can plan what recipes you would like to cook for the day, week, or month. For those who like to plan, this will be a very efficient way to plan it out. First you pick the recipes that you would like to cook, the next step will be to organize it on the calendar for either the day, week, or month.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I made this page not to big I didn't want to overwhelm the user at the beginning to I made it so that it give a brief explanation of what the website does and I section of frequwntly asked questions about the website.
      </p>

      <h3>Recipe Book</h3>
      <p>         
        For this page at first it will show the many recipe book that the user has when they click one a small page will drop and it will have the many recipes that that book has when they click on a recipe another small page will drop down and it will have the recipe they they clicked on.

      <h3>Meal Prep</h3>
      <p>         
        FOr this page I will have a calender, and that is where the user will be able to organizer their meal prep goign day by day. This will helped them see what they need to get when they are cooking and also if they need a grocery list.
